 Problem:    Permutation Sequence
 Difficulty: Easy
 Source:     https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/

 Problem Description:
 Permutation Sequence: 

 The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

 By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
 We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

 "123"
 "132"
 "213"
 "231"
 "312"
 "321"
 Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

 Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

 Notes:
 1. First implementation, math.
 2. Be smart and efficient when calculating n!.
 3. Compile using g++: g++ PermutationSequence.cpp -o PermutationSequence.
